    <h1>Veggie Man</h1>
    <p><h2>Story</h2>
      Veggie Man is lives in a dark world. No matter what choices he makes his world becomes more polluted and is slowly dying. He tries his best to only eat Vegetables because meat is detrimental to his health and leaves a Carbon footprint. He soon discovers that even if he eats only Vegetables he still leaves a carbon footprint.

      The moral of the story is that the Veggie Mans  world can only survive for a limited amount of time unless the rules are changed. Veggie Man has no power to change this as he constrained by the structure of his world.
