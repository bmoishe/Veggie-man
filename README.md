# Project Title

Veggie Man

## background
I built this game for my Brothers as I had not got him a present yet and I had a goal to build my first game. He is also Vegan so that inspired the theme.

## Story
Veggie Man is lives in a dark world where no matter what choices he makes life just get harder. He tries his best to only eat Vegetables as the meat is detrimental to his health. But the more he eats the harder it becomes.

## How to play
You will move around using UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT keys on the keyboard.

When you eat red meat you leave a carbon footprint. (White square)

When you eat green veg you also leave a carbon footprint. (White square)

You need to avoid colliding into the carbon footprints or else you will be reborn again with 0 score.

You will also need to avoid crashing into the sides or else you will be reborn again with 0 score.

When you eat you leave a carbon footprint and this makes it harder to get around the board.
